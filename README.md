# My Size Presets

This is my **personal** A1111 extension with handy buttons for all my preferred
image sizes.

Feel free to use this extension, but you have to know how to install an extension from 
a URL, no further settings nor support. You want different image sizes? Edit the script 
`scripts/my-size-presets.py`!
